# Nutrition Cost
## Language: C++; Time Complexity: O(NlogN); Concept: Greedy

Given `N` food items, each providing an essential vitamin `Ai` and costing `Bi`, the goal is to maximize the value:  
**CX-Y**
where:

- C is a constant
- X is the number of distinct vitamins
- Y is the total cost of the selected food items.

We are allowed to purchase no food items, wherein the output is zero.

### Approach

- For each distinct vitamin, it is optimal to purchase the food item offering that vitamin at the minimum cost. Minimising Y maximises CX-Y.

- Use a map to store the minimum cost for each vitamin. For each food item, if the vitamin is already present in the map, update its cost only if the current itemâ€™s cost is lower. Each insertion into a map is log N.

- Store the minimum costs of all distinct vitamins into a vector and sort it in ascending order. We then evaluate all possible subsets of vitamins, starting with the cheapest.

- Iterate through the sorted costs, keeping track of the maximum value obtained. This is the number of vitamins to be purchased.

- If no subset gives a positive value, output 0.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int t; cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int n,c; cin>>n>>c;
        vector <int> a(n), b(n);
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> a[i];
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> b[i];
        map <int,int> mp;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
        int v=a[i], cost=b[i];
        if (mp.count(v)) mp[v] = min(mp[v], cost);
        else mp[v] = cost;
        }
        vector<int> costs;
        for (auto it : mp) // auto assigns the type to the variables automatically. 
        {
        int vitamin = it.first;
        int cost = it.second;
        costs.push_back(cost);
        }
        sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
        int sum = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.size(); i++) 
        {
        sum += costs[i];
        ans = max(ans, c*(i+1)-sum);
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of `vector<int> costs`

Let's say this is map mp with all the distinct vitamins and their minimum costs:
```cpp
mp = {
    2: 3,   //key:value pair
    4: 7,   
    7: 5
}
```
Now we just want to collect the values (5, 3, 10) and put them into a vector like:
```cpp
vector<int> costs = {3, 7, 5};
```
Then we sort this list to get:
```cpp
costs = {3, 5, 7}
```
