We are given a natural number X and by performing certain operations our goal is to reduce it to the smallest possible number. 
`if X>3, X-= 3`  
`if X is even, X/=2`

**Thought Process**

- if x is odd and greater than 3, subtracting 3 is the only and the correct choice.  
- if x is less than 3:  
        X=1, X unchanged  
        X=2, X= 2/2= 1  
        X=3, X unchanged  
3.
