# A. Skibidus and Amogâ€™u
## Language: Python 3; Time Complexity: O(N); Concept: String Manipulation

Every singular noun in this language ends with "us", and to convert it to plural, I just needed to drop the "us" and add an "i" instead.

```python
t = int(input())

for x in range(t):
    s_noun = input().strip()
    print(s_noun[:-2] + 'i')
```
